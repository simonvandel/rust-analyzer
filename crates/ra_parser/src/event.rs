//! This module provides a way to construct a `File`.
//! It is intended to be completely decoupled from the
//! parser, so as to allow to evolve the tree representation
//! and the parser algorithm independently.
//!
//! The `TreeSink` trait is the bridge between the parser and the
//! tree builder: the parser produces a stream of events like
//! `start node`, `finish node`, and `FileBuilder` converts
//! this stream to a real tree.
